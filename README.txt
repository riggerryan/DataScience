This sentiment analysis project is an exploration into classifying positive and negative reviews based on the comment/ review given. To do this, I have used a nueral network which will tokenise words in groups of 4, and train the model to detect whether a review is negative or positive based on this. In the end, the model did turn out to be somewhat accurate, but has a lot of room for improvement. One way to do this I think is with adding more words for a sentence. Cropping a sentence prematurely could result in incomplete and confusing grammar for the model.
